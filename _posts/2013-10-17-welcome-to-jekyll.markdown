To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Pages will live in the _pages directory.

Knowledge Base articles will live in the _articles directory.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('AJ')
#=> prints 'Hi, AJ' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
