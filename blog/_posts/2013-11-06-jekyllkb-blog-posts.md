The Knowledge Base

You'll find this article in your `kb/_posts` directory - edit this article and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new articles, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('AJ')
#=> prints 'Hi, AJ' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
