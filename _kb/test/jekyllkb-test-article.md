You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Pages can be added to the root of directory. The about/index.html page is an example.

Knowledge Base articles will live in the kb/_posts directory.  
The Knowledge Base index page is located at kb/index.html.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('AJ')
#=> prints 'Hi, AJ' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
